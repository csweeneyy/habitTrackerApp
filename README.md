*** WORK IN PROGRESS ***

The HabitTrackerApp uses postgresql and python to provide a terminal-based (eventually a GUI) 'habit tracker' that 
allows a user to create habits and the app will email the user daily reminders to input relevant information and 
'complete' the habit for that day. Examples of preset habits are 'weight loss' and 'drink more water', but the user 
can create their own custom habit.

--- For now, habit_tracker.py uses while loops to access information 
    and the 'home/start' page, but eventually this will be facilated
    by an integrated GUI such as tkinter.
